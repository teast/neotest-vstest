# Neotest VSTest

Neotest adapter for dotnet

- Based on the VSTest for dotnet allowing test functionality similar to those found in IDEs like Rider and Visual Studio.
  - Will use the new [Microsoft.Testing.Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/microsoft-testing-platform-intro?tabs=dotnetcli) when available for newer projects.
- Supports all testing frameworks.
- DAP strategy for attaching debug adapter to test execution.
- Supports `C#` and `F#`.
- No external dependencies, only the `dotnet sdk` required.
- Can run tests on many groupings including:
  - All tests
  - Test projects
  - Test files
  - Test all methods in class
  - Test individual cases of parameterized tests

## Pre-requisites

neotest-vstest makes a number of assumptions about your environment:

1. The `dotnet sdk`, and the `dotnet` cli executable in the users runtime path.
2. (For Debugging) `netcoredbg` is installed and `nvim-dap` plugin has been configured for `netcoredbg` (see debug config for more details)
3. (recommended) treesitter parser for either `C#` or `F#` allowing run test in file functionality.
4. `neovim v0.10.0` or later

## Installation

### [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```
{
  "nsidorenco/neotest-vstest"
}
```

## Usage

```lua
require("neotest").setup({
  adapters = {
    require("neotest-vstest")
  }
})
```

The adapter optionally supports extra settings:

```lua
-- NOTE: This should be set before calling require("neotest-vstest")
--- @type neotest_vstest.Config
vim.g.neotest_vstest = {
  -- Path to dotnet sdk path.
  -- Used in cases where the sdk path cannot be auto discovered.
  sdk_path = "/usr/local/dotnet/sdk/9.0.101/",
  -- table is passed directly to DAP when debugging tests.
  dap_settings = {
    type = "netcoredbg",
  },
  -- If multiple solutions exists the adapter will ask you to choose one.
  -- If you have a different heuristic for choosing a solution you can provide a function here.
  solution_selector = function(solutions)
    return nil -- return the solution you want to use or nil to let the adapter choose.
  end,
  -- If multiple .runsettings/testconfig.json files are present in the test project directory
  -- you will be given the choice of file to use when setting up the adapter.
  -- Or you can provide a function here
  -- default nil to select from all files in project directory
  settings_selector = function(project_dir)
    return nil -- return the .runsettings/testconfig.json file you want to use or let the adapter choose
  end,
  build_opts = {
      -- Arguments that will be added to all `dotnet build` and `dotnet msbuild` commands
      additional_args = {}
  },
  -- If project contains directories which are not supposed to be searched for solution files
  discovery_directory_filter = function(search_path)
    -- ignore hidden directories
    return search_path:match("/%.")
  end,
  -- if no obvious parent solution is found, broadly scan downward for solution files from current path. This can freeze Neovim when started from broad directories.
  broad_recursive_discovery = true,
  timeout_ms = 30 * 5 * 1000, -- number of milliseconds to wait before timeout while communicating with adapter client
  -- Extensions (without leading dot) of non .cs/.fs files that vstest may report as a test's
  -- location. Code-behind generators (e.g. Reqnroll/SpecFlow) use `#line` directives in the
  -- generated .cs file to remap the test's reported file/line back to the original file
  -- (e.g. a ".feature" file), so that file needs to be treated as a test file too.
  code_behind_file_extensions = { "feature" },
}

require("neotest").setup({
  adapters = {
    require("neotest-vstest")
  }
})
```

## Debugging adapter

- Install `netcoredbg` to a location of your choosing and configure `nvim-dap` to point to the correct path

This adapter uses that standard dap strategy in `neotest`. Run it like so:

- `lua require("neotest").run.run({strategy = "dap"})`
